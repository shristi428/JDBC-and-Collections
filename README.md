# JDBC-and-Collections
using JDBC to store the data from the collections to the database 
 first we create a connection with the SQL database using JDBC .
 Next we generate   the  list of employees using collections .
 After manually collecting data we send this data into SQL database.
 If we want to display the data so we fire the SQL SELECt command to retrive the Data according to our need.
